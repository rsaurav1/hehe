    <h1 class="letter-title">Dear Pransu,</h1>

    <p class="letter-line">This isn’t a defense. This is a confession.</p>
    <p class="letter-line">I’ve been careless. Distant. I didn’t always listen when I should have.</p>
    <p class="letter-line">I blamed distance. I blamed stress. But the truth is... I could’ve done more. I could’ve shown you more love, more patience, more time.</p>
    <p class="letter-line">You were never “just someone online.” You were my comfort. My person. My hope.</p>
    <p class="letter-line">I know sorry isn’t enough ; so I’m not just saying it. I’m trying to prove it.</p>
    <p class="letter-line">You deserve better. I want to be that better.</p>

    <p class="letter-signoff">Yours (if you'll still have me),</p>
    <p class="letter-signature">Saurav</p>
